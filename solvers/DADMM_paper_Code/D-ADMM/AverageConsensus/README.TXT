This folder contains the following files:

   RunConsensus.m - A script that uses D-ADMM to solve the average 
                    consensus problem. It uses, by default, networks 
                    from the file Nets_50_nodes.mat. 
   
   AverageConsensusSubProb.m - Solver for D-ADMM

   RelativeError_Av_Consensus.m - File that computes the relative error
                                  at each D-ADMM iteration
