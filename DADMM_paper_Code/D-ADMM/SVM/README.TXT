   RunSVM.m - A script that uses D-ADMM to solve an SVM. It uses 
              networks from the file Nets_50_nodes.mat. 
   
   SVM_solver.m - Solver for D-ADMM. It uses the Matlab optimization
                  toolbox, namely the quadprog function. This is one
                  reason why the code takes a while to execute.
