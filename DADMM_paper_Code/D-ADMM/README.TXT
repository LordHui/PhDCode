This folder should contain the file

  DADMM.m - Implementation of the algorithm D-ADMM, described in

            J. Mota, J. Xavier, P. Aguiar, and M. Püschel, "D-ADMM: A 
            Communication-Efficient Distributed Algorithm For Separable 
            Optimization," Arxiv: http://arxiv.org/abs/1202.2805, 2012
   
            and

            J. Mota, J. Xavier, P. Aguiar, and M. Püschel, "Distributed Basis 
            Pursuit," IEEE Transactions Signal Processing, Vol. 60, Issue: 4, 2012
            (Arxiv link: http://arxiv.org/abs/1009.1128)


The folder should also contain several folders, each with necessary files for executing
D-ADMM for several problems. Those folders are:

  AverageConsensus - Solvers for the average consensus problem

  BPDN-RowPartition - Basis Pursuit Denoising with a row partition

  LASSO-CP - LASSO with a column partition

  SVM - Support Vector Machine
