The CTSS Sampling Toolbox is a collection of MATLAB m-files that simulate the sampling and recovery of three sub-Nyquist sampling systems: the Random Demodulator, the Modulated Wideband Converter, and the Multi-coset Sampler.

The scripts are organized into three folders corresponding to the three systems. The folder names are rd (Random Demodulator), mwc (Modulated Wideband Converter), and mc_sampler (Multi-coset Sampler). Each folder contains an additional README file that explains how to run the simulations. 

The fourth folder, named Documentation, contains three technical reports concisely explaining the mathematical theory underlying these systems. For additional information, please refer to the original references listed at <http://wwww.see.ed.ac.uk/~mlexa/CTSS.html>.
